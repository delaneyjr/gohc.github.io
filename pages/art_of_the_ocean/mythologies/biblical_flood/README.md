The biblical account is well known, but the discovery of deposits and hypotheses that the Black Sea has shrunk during the ice age, and that the Bosporus over flowed about 7-8,000 years ago as sea level rose again at the end of the most recent ice age and flooded the Black Sea basin catastrophically is viewed by some as an alternative explanation of the events that produced the Persian stories of Gilgamesh et al and became part of the stories of the Hebrews who returned from Babylon after their captivity.
