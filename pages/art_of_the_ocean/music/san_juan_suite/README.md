"Michael Gettel's "San Juan Suite" is, quite simply, one of the best new age piano recordings out there. I find it amazing that Gettel hasn't reached the popularity of pianists like George Winston and Jim Brickman. The musical impressionism on "San Juan Suite" is enough to rival that of Winston's "Autumn" and the melodies are soothing and catchy enough to compare to Brickman's "By Heart". Gettel really is, as he states in the liner notes, a musical photographer. The pieces on "San Juan Suite" capture the imagery and sounds of the San Juan Islands in a way that is truly amazing. This is a must-have new age album."
