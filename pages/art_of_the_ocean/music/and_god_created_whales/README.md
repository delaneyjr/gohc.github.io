And God Created Great Whales, Op. 229, No. 1, is a symphonic poem for orchestra and recorded whale sounds by the American composer Alan Hovhaness. The work was commissioned by Andre Kostelanetz and the New York Philharmonic, who premiered the piece on June 11, 1970 in New York City.[1] The piece has been recorded numerous times and remains one of Hovhaness's most popular compositions.[2][3][4] It has also been credited as an early work in the movement to save whales from extinction, alongside John Tavener's 1966 cantata The Whale.[5] The title of the work comes from Genesis 1:21 in the King James Version of the Bible. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_the_Humpback_Whale_(album))
