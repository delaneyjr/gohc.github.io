#### Fathom and League - by Michael Collier

"Michael has been on several cruises with with UW Scientists. This poem was one result of his dive in ALVIN (in 1991) to the seafloor of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Michael is the ultimate origin of the Bos'n's Poetry Night which we celebrated on most cruises...(The Bos'n, or Boatswain, is usually the main person on deck who oversees use all of the heavy equipment when anything is being placed other the side into the ocean or being recovered). Some Bos'ns are fond of Robert Service Poems like the Cremation of Sam McGee, or the Shooting of Dan McGrew...the original Bos'n in this case is Wayne Bailey of the R/V ATLANTIS, out of Woods Hole, MA." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collier)
