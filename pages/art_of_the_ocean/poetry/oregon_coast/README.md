# On the Oregon Coast

#### On the Oregon Coast - by Galway Kinnell

Robert Langbaum observed in the American Poetry Review that “at a time when so many poets are content to be skillful and trivial, [Kinnell] speaks with a big voice about the whole of life.” Marked by his early experiences as a Civil Rights and anti-war activist, Kinnell’s socially-engaged verse broadened in his later years to seek the essential in human nature, often by engaging the natural and animal worlds. With a remarkable career spanning many decades, Kinnell’s Selected Poems (1980) won both a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award.  

Kinnell "is a poet of the landscape, a poet of soliloquy, a poet of the city’s underside, and a poet who speaks for thieves, pushcart vendors, and lumberjacks with an unforced simulation of the vernacular," noted the Hudson Review contributor Vernon Young. - [Peotry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/galway-kinnell)


<p align="center">In memoriam Richard Hugo<br/>
  Six of seven rows of waves struggle landward<br/>
  The wind batters a pouter sheen on the valley between them.<br/>
Much of each wave making its way in gets blown back out to sea.<br/>
The bass rumble of the sea stones audible under their outreach itself<br/>
	blows out to sea.<br/>
A log maybe thirty feet long and six across at the ft end gets up<br/>
	and trundles down the beach, using its two ends like feet.<br/>
Like a dog fetching a stick, it flops unhesitatingly into the water.<br/>
An enormous wave at once sends it wallowing back up the beach.<br/>
It comes to rest among other lost logs, almost panting.<br/>
The last timeI was on this coast I had dinner with Richard Hugo<br/>
	north of here, in a restaurant over the sea.<br/>
The conversation came around to personification<br/>
We agreed that eighteenth- and nineteenth-century poets almost<br/>
	had to personify, it was like mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the<br/>
	only way they could think up to keep the world from<br/>
	becoming dead matter.<br/>
And that as post-Darwinians it was up to us to anthropomorphize<br/>
	the world less and animalize, vegetablize, and mineralize<br/>
	ourselves more.<br/>
We didn’t know if pre-Darwinian language would let us.<br/>
Our talk turned to James Wright, how his confabulations with<br/>
	reptiles, spiders, and insects drifted him back through the<br/>
	evolutionary stages.<br/>
When a group of people get up from a table, the table doesn’t<br/>
	know which way any of them will go.<br/>
James Wright went back to the end.  So did Richard Hugo.<br/>
The waves swaying in burst up through their crests and fly very<br/>
	brilliant back out to sea.<br/>
The log gets up once again, rolls and bounces down the beach<br/>
	Plunges as though for good into the water.</p>
