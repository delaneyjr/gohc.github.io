# Tectonics

#### Tectonics - by Ted Kooser  
“For more than thirty years Ted Kooser has written poems that deftly bring dissimilar things into telling unities.  Throughout a long and distinguished writing career he has worked toward clarity and accessibility, making a poetry as fresh and spontaneous as a good watercolor.  A gyroscope balanced between a child’s hands, a jar of buttons, that recalls generations of women, and a bird briefly witnessed outside a window — each reveals the remarkable within an otherwise ordinary world” —  Poetry Daily
